# Excel Foundations

This repository hosts beginner-to-intermediate Excel projects for mastering data entry, analysis, visualization, and data cleaning, tailored for a Data Engineer transition. Each folder contains a mini-project, simple datasets, and documentation. Focus on general, beginner-friendly data to build foundational skills.

## Starting Files
- **books_sample.csv**: A simple book dataset (sourced from [GitHub datablist/sample-csv-files](https://github.com/datablist/sample-csv-files)). Columns: Book Title (text), Author (text), Publication Year (number), Price (number), ISBN (text).  
  - Rows: 100 (subset to 10 rows for practice).  
  - Why? Very basic data for learning Excel’s interface and data entry.  
- **Basic_Excel_Practice.xlsx**: Sample workbook from [GitHub rohanmistry231/Practice-Datasets-for-Excel](https://github.com/rohanmistry231/Practice-Datasets-for-Excel). Blank sheets for data entry exercises. Add book data here.

## Day 1: Excel Basics - Interface and Data Entry
**Objective:** Learn Excel’s interface (ribbons, worksheets, cells) and basic data entry with a simple book dataset.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Explored Excel ribbons (Home, Insert, Data) and their functions.
- Practiced entering data: book titles, authors, publication years in `books_entry_day1.xlsx`.
- Saved and committed dataset to GitHub.

**Resources:**
- GitHub Repo: [rohanmistry231/Practice-Datasets-for-Excel](https://github.com/rohanmistry231/Practice-Datasets-for-Excel) (README with basic Excel tips).
- YouTube: [ExcelIsFun Basics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M4r0G7b9jA&list=PLrRPvpgDmw0n34OMHeS94epP1sN3v0fbV) (watch first 10 min for interface).
- YouTube: [Leila Gharani Excel for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl0H-qTclOg) (first 10 min for ribbons, data entry).
- Dataset Source: [datablist Sample CSV](https://github.com/datablist/sample-csv-files) (free book data).

## Projects (Planned)
- **Expense Tracker:** Automate personal expenses and visualize them. (Week 2: Formulas & Charts).
- **Sales Dashboard:** Analyze sample sales data and report trends. (Week 3: PivotTables).
- **Attendance Sheet:** Build an automated tracker with summaries. (Week 4: Data Cleaning).

**Next Steps:**
- Day 2: Learn basic formulas (SUM, AVERAGE) for book data (e.g., average price).
- Track progress: Commit daily via GitHub (`git add .`, `git commit -m "Day 1 complete"`, `git push`).

**Tips for Data Engineering Transition:** Use these files to practice ETL basics (Extract from CSV, Transform in Excel, Load to new sheet). Simple data builds confidence for data pipelines.
